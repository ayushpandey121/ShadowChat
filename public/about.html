            <h2>How It Started</h2>
            <p>Started as a fun project last year, we decided to build it into a full-fledged website
                for students to interact with each other. Our aim is to help facilitate conversation among 
                students and reduce the communication gap. Inspired by the Video Chat-Roulletes available 
                in the market we decided to build one specifically for our college.

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>
                We initially thought of using MongoDB as the database for this project but then resorted to
                firebase. It is because firebase is helpful in authenticating users and also it offers a realtime
                database for random match-making. We tried using firebase as the signalling server for our project
                but it was too complex for us to implement. That's why we used JavaScript's PeerJS library for handling
                the calls between connected peers.

                The website itself is based on vanilla HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

            <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>Currently our website is limited to connections made over mobile data because NAT traversal is a huge issue
                in our institution. It is because of the firewall security rules that we are limited to use the STUN servers.
                In future we are hoping to implement a TURN server when normal connection cannot be established.
